# Spring Boot JPA

## Overview

Project developed during the [Spring Boot & Spring Data JPA - Complete Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rNk7m_zlAg) by freeCodeCamp and [Bouali Ali](https://www.youtube.com/@BoualiAli). The intention was to study Spring Data JPA, revisit old concepts, and learn new ones.

## Objective

Using the Spring Framework, relational database concepts, and object-oriented programming to create an application based on the diagram below, and then applying queries and specifications.
